scoop is developed by google at 2002.
it has mapper and reuducer. mapper is to copy the files from one area to the another area. Reducer is to do opertions on the analytical data on the mapper on hdfs.
just general overview,, i am not sure, but i try.... walk by faith not by sight.

ls - used to see list of all files
ls -a used to see all the hidden files
ls -lart used to see all the hidden files along with the file size
ls -lrt used to see all the files
using ls -a cat the .bash_history file to see all the recently typed files, .bashrc files is to view the vriables tht are declred globally..

grep commands are used to see the searched word along with the files.

shell script are a combination of all the linux commands, once executed it will be an automated process...
2 ways to start a shell script. one is using ./   , another one is by using bash bashfile.sh
